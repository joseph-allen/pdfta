title   : Why We are Different
description: >
  A lot of projects go through months of planning before implementation, these hoops slow down the value added from many Machine Learning products. PDFTA doesn't believe in throwing a project "over the wall" to your developers, we work with you to deliver something you can proudly maintain long after we are gone.
  <br> <br>
  We believe in value-first delivery. The sooner we are using real data the better. We work in iterative development cycles with transparent workflow so you have confidence in our delivery.
