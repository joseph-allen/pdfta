### Data Science Panel at Reason Digital
Here at PDFTA we  support the local community. We have organisational involvement in [PyDataMCR](https://twitter.com/pydatamcr) and [EndHomelessnes](https://www.meetup.com/EndHomelessness-digital-community/). At the start of 2019 we reached out to charitable companies to get more involved. [Reason Digitals’ reputation](https://reasondigital.com/) preceded them, we wanted to talk.

Reason Digital use technology for good, and that’s something we can get behind. We met with [Rachel Lane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelslane/) to find out how we could help. Reason Digital wanted to know how they could help  social enterprises enter the world of Data . Small companies have small budgets, plenty of data and big ambitions. Small companies have a lot to gain from low hanging fruit.

But we couldn’t stop at being on a data panel, where is the fun in that? The staff of Reason Digital had whiteboards at the ready. Live drawing of the narrative gave way to spectacular results.
