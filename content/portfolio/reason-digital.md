### Data Science Panel at Reason Digital
With Rachel Lanes assitence we were brought in to answer some questions from Reason Digital, a medium sized agency based here in Manchester. We talked about chatbots, machine learning and how to help small companies with low budgets gleam meaningful insights from the data they've been hoarding.

The attendees live-drew the event which gave some spectacular results.
